Dependency Installers for SPARQL Unicorn QGIS Plugin

This repository contains installers which install dependencies for the SPARQL Unicorn QGIS Plugin.
Dependencies need to be installed in the following filepath:
C:\$PROGRAMS\$QGISFOLDER\apps\$PYTHONFOLDER\Lib\site-packages\
whereas 
* $PROGRAMS points to the Program Files folder in Windows
* $QGISFOLDER points to the folder in which QGIS is installed e.g. QGIS 3.10
* $PYTHONFOLDER points to the folder of the Python instance delivered with QGIS e.g. Python37

We provide installers for different versions of QGIS beginning with QGIS 3.10
